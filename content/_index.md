      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        My research primarily revolves around [**customer engagement**](/publication/roopak-framing-2024/), with a particular focus on its psychological and contextual underpinnings in digital environments.
        
        I have investigated **psychological antecedents** such as the [**need for validation**](/publication/roopak-engaged-2025/), social needs, and status needs to understand what motivates consumers to engage in [**online brand communities (OBCs)**](/publication/roopak-engaged-2025/). Drawing on frameworks such as **Self-Determination Theory** and **Social Exchange Theory**. This research explores how intrinsic motivations shape participation in online brand communities.
        
        To advance conceptual clarity, I conducted a [**systematic and multimethod review**](/publication/roopak-framing-2024/) of customer engagement research. This study identifies evolving **framing strategies**, theoretical gaps, and future research trajectories across marketing and consumer behavior domains.
        
        In applied work, I examine how [**digital storytelling**](/publication/roopak-eco-stories-2025/) can foster engagement with sustainability-focused brands. My recent case study on *Rustic HueÂ®* illustrates how ethical fashion brands use storytelling to build **cultural relevance**, enhance consumer trust, and communicate environmental practices such as upcycling and zero-waste production.
        
        Currently, I am expanding this line of inquiry to explore **sustainable consumer behavior** through the lens of **engagement**, examining how psychological drivers continue to shape pro-social and eco-conscious interactions in digital and experiential contexts.
        
        In parallel, I am developing a theoretical stream using [**game theory**](/) to model platform strategies around [**digital consent transparency**](/), and examine its implications for user utility, firm incentives, and public policy.
