 abstract = {This case study examines Rustic Hue® (RH), a sustainable fashion brand committed to ethical practices, cultural heritage, and environmental protection. RH faced challenges in effectively communicating their orientation and commitment to social, economic and environmental sustainability while differentiating themselves in a crowded market. To overcome this challenge, RH implemented strategic digital storytelling in an innovative manner. They utilized their own digital media, including social media and the website, to showcase collaborations with weaving communities, highlight design innovations and customer testimonials. These approaches helped RH to foster trust, transparency, enhanced market recognition, and establish cultural relevance. Beyond sharing product- oriented stories, they also emphasize and publish on environmental responsibility through their "Jugaad" line, which promotes upcycling and zero- waste practices. Furthermore, RH documents the lives and practices of these communities and shares research findings to promote public awareness and appreciation. © 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.
