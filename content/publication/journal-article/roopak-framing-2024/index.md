abstract: 'This study aims to perform the bibliometric analysis of the customer engagement
  (CE) literature, highlights the major research themes and classifies the subdomains.
  The study also identifies antecedents and consequences, as well as dimension evolution,
  and suggests future research directions.,This study used a comprehensive bibliometric
  approach using Scopus data from 2002 to January 2024. Advanced analytical techniques,
  including bibliometric and cocitation analysis using R and bibexcel, were used.
  In addition, machine learning (ML)-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used
  to extract latent themes.,This study reveals the domainâ€™s past trend and present
  research scenario. The thematic analysis of CE is classified into three phases.
  Document cocitation analysis provided four broad clusters: conceptualization and
  operationalization, value creation through engagement, building relationships with
  brands and engagement-social media interface. The antecedents and consequences are
  categorized and presented along with the evolution of the multidimensional nature
  of CE.,This study adds to the literature in two key ways. First, the entire scholarly
  production has been compiled into one frame. Second, multiple methods were used
  to unravel citation, cocitation and textual data. Furthermore, ML-based LDA was
  used to extract latent themes from clusters and future research directions were
  proposed.'
