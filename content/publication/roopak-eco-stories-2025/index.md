abstract: This case study examines Rustic Hue® (RH), a sustainable fashion brand committed
  to ethical practices, cultural heritage, and environmental protection. RH faced
  challenges in effectively communicating their orientation and commitment to social,
  economic and environmental sustainability while differentiating themselves in a
  crowded market. To overcome this challenge, RH implemented strategic digital storytelling
  in an innovative manner. They utilized their own digital media, including social
  media and the website, to showcase collaborations with weaving communities, highlight
  design innovations and customer testimonials. These approaches helped RH to foster
  trust, transparency, enhanced market recognition, and establish cultural relevance.
  Beyond sharing product- oriented stories, they also emphasize and publish on environmental
  responsibility through their \"Jugaad\" line, which promotes upcycling and zero-
  waste practices. Furthermore, RH documents the lives and practices of these communities
  and shares research findings to promote public awareness and appreciation. © 2025,
