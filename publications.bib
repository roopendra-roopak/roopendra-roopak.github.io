	abstract = {This case study examines Rustic Hue® (RH), a sustainable fashion brand committed to ethical practices, cultural heritage, and environmental protection. RH faced challenges in effectively communicating their orientation and commitment to social, economic and environmental sustainability while differentiating themselves in a crowded market. To overcome this challenge, RH implemented strategic digital storytelling in an innovative manner. They utilized their own digital media, including social media and the website, to showcase collaborations with weaving communities, highlight design innovations and customer testimonials. These approaches helped RH to foster trust, transparency, enhanced market recognition, and establish cultural relevance. Beyond sharing product- oriented stories, they also emphasize and publish on environmental responsibility through their "Jugaad" line, which promotes upcycling and zero- waste practices. Furthermore, RH documents the lives and practices of these communities and shares research findings to promote public awareness and appreciation. © 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

	abstract = {This study aims to perform the bibliometric analysis of the customer engagement (CE) literature, highlights the major research themes and classifies the subdomains. The study also identifies antecedents and consequences, as well as dimension evolution, and suggests future research directions.,This study used a comprehensive bibliometric approach using Scopus data from 2002 to January 2024. Advanced analytical techniques, including bibliometric and cocitation analysis using R and bibexcel, were used. In addition, machine learning (ML)-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to extract latent themes.,This study reveals the domain’s past trend and present research scenario. The thematic analysis of CE is classified into three phases. Document cocitation analysis provided four broad clusters: conceptualization and operationalization, value creation through engagement, building relationships with brands and engagement-social media interface. The antecedents and consequences are categorized and presented along with the evolution of the multidimensional nature of CE.,This study adds to the literature in two key ways. First, the entire scholarly production has been compiled into one frame. Second, multiple methods were used to unravel citation, cocitation and textual data. Furthermore, ML-based LDA was used to extract latent themes from clusters and future research directions were proposed.},

	abstract = {Online Brand Communities (OBCs) are powerful platforms for fostering customer participation, retention, and engagement. However, existing research on online customer engagement (OCE) often underexplores the role of fundamental psychological needs. This study addresses that gap using a mixed-methods approach. Study 1 (qualitative, phenomenological) identifies three key drivers of OBC engagement—social needs, status needs, and the need for validation. Study 2 (quantitative) integrates Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Social Exchange Theory (SET) to develop and test a model linking these needs to personal and social integrative benefits via OCE, using data from 416 Indian users analysed through PLS-SEM. The results show that social needs and the need for validation significantly drive OCE, which in turn substantially influences both benefit types. OCE fully mediates the relationship between need for validation and personal-integrative benefits, and partially mediates the effect of social need on personal-integrative benefits and social-integrative benefits. Additionally, OCE partially mediates the relationship between need for validation and social-integrative benefits. The study contributes to the CE literature by offering a unified SDT–SET framework that captures both the motivational and relational dimensions of engagement and reconceptualises the need for validation as a key antecedent of OCE. Managerially, it highlights the need for brands to focus on fostering social connection and affirmation, rather than status-based incentives, to build more meaningful and enduring community relationships.},
